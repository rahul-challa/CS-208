1. Check the Service Description
Run:

kubectl describe ksvc java-app
Look for errors in the Conditions section. It might indicate why the revision is missing.

2. Check Knative Revisions
List the revisions:


kubectl get revision
If there are no revisions, the service might have failed to create one.
If there is a revision, check its status.
3. Check Knative Configuration
Run:

kubectl get configuration java-app -o yaml
Look for issues such as:

Image pull errors
Missing or incorrect environment variables
4. Check Pod Status
Knative uses Kubernetes deployments behind the scenes. Check if pods are being created:

kubectl get pods --selector=serving.knative.dev/service=java-app
If no pods are running, check logs.

5. Check Logs for Errors
Check logs for potential issues:


kubectl logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=java-app --all-containers
or


kubectl logs deploy/java-app-deployment
Look for errors related to the container image, runtime, or environment variables.

6. Check Events
Run:


kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
This will show any failures in pulling the image, permission issues, or other deployment failures.

7. Manually Redeploy the Service
Try deleting the Knative service and redeploying it:


kubectl delete ksvc java-app
kubectl apply -f java-app.yaml
